A dictionary is a collection that stores data as key-value pairs. 

Using dictionary, we can store data in key-value.

Creating a dictionary:

```bash
person = {
    "name": "Sara",
    "age": 25,
    "job": "teacher"
}
```

Accessing values:

```bash
print(person["name"])  # Sara
print(person["job"])   # teacher
```
